> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- The experience was pleasant overall, the project was the highlight of the course. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I'm used to writing detailed step-by-step instructions for customers in my current job, so it came naturally to me. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - This was my first time doing this, so there's no other tools or styles that I know of, so no.   


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I'm familiar with VSCode, so I used it for this assignment.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I had trouble narrowing down the test cases, until I read the assignment more thoroughly and noticed that they were given to us, so that solved it.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- No troubles with Github, since I've used it in most of my courses in school.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Honestly, I wouldn't even know. My friends have uset Robot Framework, and said it was okay to use.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Cypress, JS testing, Kubernetes and Cucumber & Gherkin to name a few.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Well, I lack the same tecnhical skills that's in demand right now. Soft skills I've think I got already.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- Like I said, this project was the higlight of the course for me. I'm more of a hands in mud type of learner, so I tend to learn best by doing. If I could suggest, it would be great to have another project of some sort as well, so that people like me would be more engaged during the course. But overall, I think that I got a basic understanding of software testing, which was the idea all along.
